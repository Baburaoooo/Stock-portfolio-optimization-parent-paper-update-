# Stock-Portfolio-Optimization-Project

## About
Class project implementing stock portfolio optimization using nature-inspired algorithms with proper academic dataset splitting methodology.

## Project Description
I have designed project of stock portfolio optmization. Portfolio optimization involves constructing an investment portfolio that maximizes returns while minimizing risk. Here, we develop the financial decision support system that leverages AI's nature-inspired algorithms for optimized stock portfolio selection. 

The novelty in methodology is we are 'hybridizing' nature-inspired algorithms for optimized stock portfolio selection with three independent modules. The first module involves stock price prediction using machine learning. The second module consists of calculating the intrinsic value of stocks based on fundamentals and assessing each stock's potential value. The third module conducts a comprehensive financial health analysis of each stock, generating a health fitness value that represents the fitness level of the stocks in consideration. The fourth module utilizes a nature-inspired algorithm/s to select stocks for the portfolio based on the values obtained from the previous three modules. This integrated approach aids in the effective decision-making process for portfolio selection by considering multiple dimensions of stock performance.

For this work, custom datasets are designed according to the needs of each input module using historical fundamental stock data. 

After different results comparison, we conclude that our optimized portfolios with varying values of constraints more than 80% of the time outperform US market indices returns.

## Academic Implementation
This implementation includes proper train/test/validation dataset splitting (70/20/10) for academic rigor and credible results.
