# Stock Portfolio Optimization Project - Dataset Split Implementation

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

I have successfully implemented the required train/test/validation dataset split for your Stock Portfolio Optimization Project as requested for your Canvas assignment.

## üìä Dataset Split Summary

Your main dataset `Final_Input_dataset_for_DSS.csv` (457 samples) has been split into:

| Dataset | Samples | Percentage | Purpose |
|---------|---------|------------|---------|
| **Training** | 319 | 69.8% | Algorithm development & parameter tuning |
| **Test** | 92 | 20.1% | Performance evaluation & comparison |
| **Validation** | 46 | 10.1% | Final unbiased assessment |

## üìÅ Files Created

### Split Datasets
- `train_dataset.csv` - Training dataset (319 samples)
- `test_dataset.csv` - Test dataset (92 samples)  
- `validation_dataset.csv` - Validation dataset (46 samples)

### Updated Code Files
- `Stock_portfolio_optimization_using_SHLO_updated.py` - Updated SHLO implementation
- `Stock_portfolio_selection_by_hill_climbing_updated.py` - Updated Hill Climbing implementation
- `dataset_splitter.py` - Script used to create the splits
- `test_dataset_splits.py` - Verification script

### Documentation
- `DATASET_SPLIT_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Comprehensive documentation

## Verification Results

All tests passed successfully:
- ‚úì All datasets load correctly with proper structure
- ‚úì No duplicate samples across splits
- ‚úì Total samples match original dataset (457)
- ‚úì Datasets are compatible with optimization algorithms
- ‚úì All required columns present and data integrity maintained

##  Academic Compliance

This implementation follows the standard machine learning methodology:

1. **70% Training** - For developing and optimizing your SHLO and Hill Climbing algorithms
2. **20% Testing** - For evaluating and comparing algorithm performance  
3. **10% Validation** - For final unbiased performance assessment

**IMPORTANT**: The validation dataset is kept completely separate until final testing, ensuring no data leakage and providing credible results for academic evaluation.

##  Next Steps

1. **Development Phase**: Use `train_dataset.csv` to develop and optimize your algorithms
2. **Testing Phase**: Use `test_dataset.csv` to evaluate performance and compare algorithms
3. **Final Validation**: Use `validation_dataset.csv` ONLY for final performance assessment
4. **Documentation**: Record results from each phase for your research paper

## üìã Usage Instructions

The updated code files include dataset mode configuration:

```python
DATASET_MODE = "train"      # For training
DATASET_MODE = "test"       # For testing  
DATASET_MODE = "validation" # For final validation
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders

- **Never use the validation set during development**
- **Keep validation results separate until final testing**
- **Document which dataset was used for each experiment**
- **Maintain reproducibility using the same random seed (42)**

## üéì Academic Benefits

This implementation ensures your research:
- Follows proper machine learning methodology
- Provides credible, unbiased results
- Meets Canvas assignment requirements
- Demonstrates understanding of dataset splitting best practices
- Enables proper algorithm comparison and evaluation

Your Stock Portfolio Optimization Project is now ready for proper academic evaluation with the implemented train/test/validation split methodology!
